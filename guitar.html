				<p style="color:blue">Welcome to my page where I talk about one of my hobbies: playing guitar!</p>

				<p>One of Nicholas' favorite hobbies is playing the guitar. He began playing in 4th grade, and has played for about 10 years. 
				Nicholas has a black Paul Reed Smith SE (as seen in the picture below). He is self-taught and enjoys playing casually and practicing whenever he has 
				free time outside of school! He enjoys playing rock, metal, punk, and new wave music, and mainly learns songs from his favorite bands. Nicholas
				hopes that in the future, he can become good enough to join a band with his friends. He also wants to save up enough money to get a new guitar and
				amplifier (guitars and amplifiers are expensive!).</p>

				<p>This guitar is specifically the Fredrik Akesson signature model SE. Although Nicholas does not know any of Fredrik Akesson's music,
					he liked the design of the guitar when he was at Guitar Center buying his first guitar.</p>
