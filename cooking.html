				<p style="color:blue">Welcome to my page where I talk about one of my favorite hobbies: cooking!</p>

				<p>One of Nicholas' favorite hobbies is cooking, either for just himself, or his roommate and girlfriend. Nicholas grew up in an Italian family, and 
					learned how to cook from his grandmother. Because of this, he is the most familiar cooking Italian cuisine, but he also enjoys branching out and 
					learning how to cook other foods from other countries and cultures! Nicholas enjoys cooking, as well as baking, and likes making homemade cookies, 
					pies, and brownies for his friends and family. For the future, Nicholas wants to buy a nicer set of pots and pans, a food processor, and a good set 
					of knives as well to use for cooking. One of his favorite kitchen items is his stovetop Bialetti Moka Pot Express, used to make espresso!</p>
