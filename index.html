				<h2>About Me:</h2>

				<p>Nicholas Censoprano is currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and lives in downtown Madison. He has moved around the U.S. during his 
				life and has lived in multiple different states and cities, but his family currently resides in Hudson, Ohio. He is majoring in History, with 
				Certificates in Art History, European Studies, and Italian. Nicholas' academic interests include the study of U.S. foreign policy, 
				the history of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the study of U.S. Empire in Latin America and Southeast Asia. He currently works for the UW-Madison 
				Department of History as a George L. Mosse Undergraduate Peer Advisor in History, helping students navigate the history program offered at UW and 
				answering any questions they might have about future coursework or their remaining requirements for their degrees. After graduation from UW-Madison 
				in May 2023, Nicholas plans on attending graduate school to pursue a Master's degree in Library and Information Science. Since he lives in Ohio, one of 
				his top choices for graduate school for his M.L.I.S. is <a href="https://www.kent.edu/iSchool/library-information-science">Kent State University</a>, 
				a school that has a great ALA-accredited program in Library Science. He is also applying to prestigious M.L.I.S. programs at 
				<a href="https://ischool.wisc.edu/current-students/masters-degree-program/"> The University of Wisconsin-Madison Information School</a>, 
				as well as <a href="https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/academics/graduate/mlis/">The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>.
				For his professional career, Nicholas wants to work in the field of libraries, museums, and archives, as he is passionate about sharing history with 
				others in an accessible and interactive way.</p>
